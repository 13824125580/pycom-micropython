========================

.. warning::
    Be gentle when plugging/unplugging the USB cable. Whilst the USB connector is well soldered and is relatively strong,
    if it breaks off it can be very difficult to fix.

.. warning::
    Static electricity can shock the components on the module and destroy them. If you experience a lot of static electricity
    in your area (eg dry and cold climates), take extra care not to shock the module.  If your module came in a ESD bag, then
    this bag is the best way to store and carry the module as it will protect it against static discharges.
