.. warning::

   The GPIO pins of the LoPy are NOT 5V tolerant, connecting them to voltages higher
   than 3.3V might cause irreparable damage to the board.

.. warning::
    Static electricity can shock the components on the module and destroy them. If you experience a lot of static electricity
    in your area (eg dry and cold climates), take extra care not to shock the module.  If your module came in a ESD bag, then
    this bag is the best way to store and carry the module as it will protect it against static discharges.
